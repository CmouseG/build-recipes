# JS Build Config Recipes
*_Configuring the build system for projects is a pain in the ass!_*

This is simple collection of config & build system recipes for bootstrapping (bare-bones versions) of popular frameworks.

#### Try it out
To test thing out locally, simply uncomment the line for the framework you want to use in rollup.config.js, and run `yarn knit` to start the server.

## React
client/react

## Riot

## Vue
